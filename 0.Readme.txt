Hi.

...an SMB protocol suite implementation in Python.  SMB in PYthon.

This project is new.  So far we have only a partial implementation of the
NBT transport layer.  Stay tuned.


Patch Submissions
=================

If you want to contribute something, we would just be tickled pink, but
please note the licensing philosophy discussion below.  If you submit
patches, we reserve the right to re-license the resulting code.  That
includes docstrings and such-like that are part of the finished product.

The goal is to ensure that we can contribute portions of the project to the
Python Software Foundation (PSF), which has its own licensing requirements.

See:  https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq


Licensing Philosophy
====================

This code is provided with the hope that it is both usable and useful, but
without any promises regarding net weight, color, the quality of the bits
used to represent the code on any computer or in any form of data
transmission, fitness for any specific purpose, or the number of jelly beans
in the giant jam jar.  We're just putting this out there with the wild wish
that it will make someone happier than they already hopefully are.

These modules are licensed under either the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL) or the GNU Affero General Public License.  If there were a
GNU Affero LGPL we would use that instead of the regular LGPL.  In all
cases, we are using version 3.0 of the licenses or (as they say) any later
version.

In general, code modules that provide classes but which are not really
programs on their own are licensed under the LGPL.  Example programs,
working servers, testing programs, etc., are licensed under the AGPL.  See
the individual files for specifics, but the licensing is intended to make
sense.

As explained above, if the code proves to be useful, stable, weighty,
popular, florescent, effervescent, or otherwise beneficial to the general
populace, we may attempt to donate important modules to the Python Software
Foundation (PSF).  Doing so would require that the donated code be released
under an additional license.


Ramblings
=========

A quick Internet search shows that there have been a handful of attempts
to create an SMB client in Python, and a possibly a few tries at an SMB
server.

Here we go again.

We are trying to meet the following goals:
- Provide a useful SMB2/3 client and server implementation in Python.  We
  don't expect that it'll be wildly fast, but we do want it to be both
  reliable and useful.  (SMB1 may follow later on.  SMB2/3 is a higher
  priority for now.)
- Provide modular support for additional protocols, such as the Distributed
  File System (see [MS-DFSC]).
- Provide clear and complete documentation.  The pydoc output in all of our
  modules should be be enough to get you started, and provide useful links
  to further information if you want to dig deeper.
- Act as a guide for others who want to implement some aspect of the SMB
  suite.  We're trying to keep the code clean and clear and commented so
  that that it's not only clear what the code is doing, but why it's doing
  it.

That's pretty lofty, particularly since we've only gotten as far as the NBT
transport layer so far.  On the other hand, the project has some
excperienced SMB folks involved and what we've produced so far is living up
to our goals.


Words
=====

CIFS    Common Internet File System.  CIFS is the "marketing upgrade"
        name that was bestowed upon the SMB protocol in the mid-1990's.  For
        a while, some in the community used the CIFS name to refer to suite
        of protocols that centered upon SMB, including SMB, NBT, the Browser
        protocols, DFS, Mailslot protocol, and a few others.

        CIFS is now considered a dead name.  Microsoft doesn't use it any
        more, except in older documentation or references to legacy
        implementations.

SMB     Server Message Block protocol.  SMB was originally created by
        IBM in the early 1980's for use with PC-DOS.  SMB was updated and
        extended for use with OS/2, and was eventually ported to Windows.
        The ported version, known as "NT LM 0.12", has remained very much
        the same since then.

SMB1    Also known as SMBv1, CIFS, or "NT LM 0.12", SMB1 is the designation
        given to the "NT LM 0.12" dialect of the original SMB protocol as
        implemented in all versions of Windows since Windows NT 3.51.  The
        SMB1 name may be thought of as excluding older OS/2 LAN Manger and
        DOS versions of SMB, except that the Windows NT LAN Manager
        implementation is (mostly) backward compatible with those older
        versions.  (See [MS-CIFS]; changes to SMB1 between Windows NT4 and
        all subsequent Windows versions are documented in [MS-SMB].)

SMB2    A.K.A. SMBv2;  SMB2 is not a dialect of SMB1;  SMB2 is a different
        protocol.  It does, however, share many characteristics with SMB1.
        SMB2 was introduced in Windows Vista.  This original release was not
        particularly ambitious, and its existence was hardly noticed at the
        time.  SMBv2.1 was released with Windows 7.  SMB2.2 was scheduled
        for release with Windows 8, but see the description of SMB3.
        (See [MS-SMB2].)

SMB3    A.K.A. SMBv3 or SMB2.2;  SMB3 is, in fact, a dialect of SMB2.  It
        was originally intended to be released as SMB version 2.2 but it
        contained a number of new features and so was re-dubbed SMB3 (what
        you might call a "marketing upgrade").  SMB3 supports I/O over RDMA
        as well as scale-out and failover clustering.  SMB3 is documented in
        [MS-SMB2].
