# Notes:
#
#   It is expected that descendant classes will be created from the
#   CodedError class.  The only thing that needs to be done to create a new,
#   working class is to assign a dictionary to the error_dict class variable.
#   The dictionary should map error codes (integer or long values) to short
#   strings, which are typically the names associated with the errors.
#   For example:
#     { 0: 'SUCCESS',
#       1: 'ANNOYANCE',
#       2: 'DISTURBANCE',
#       3: "UTTER_FAILURE" }

indicate a particular error based upon an error code.

class CodedError( Exception ):
  """Error code interface class.

  This is an interface (incomplete) class that serves as a framework for
  building exception classes that are based on error codes.  Each
  descendant class is defined with its own set of error codes, which
  are mapped to descriptive names.

  Class Attributes:
    error_dict  - A dictionary that maps error codes to descriptive
                  names.  This dictionary defines the set of valid
                  error codes.

  Instance Attributes:
    eCode   - The error code number that was used to raise the
              exception.
    message - A(n optional) descriptive string to help the user
              interpret a particular instance.
    value   - A(n optional) value of almost any type.  If <value> is
              not None, it should be convertable into a string so that
              it can be printed when the error message is displayed.
              The interpretation of this value may be different for
              each class and each error code defined within the class.

            error code is not defined, or if it is defined but
            the message was set to None.

    Notes:  CodedError() descendant classes can be created simply by
            assigning a dictionary of number/string pairs to the
