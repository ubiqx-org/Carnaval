# Notes:
#
#   - This module currently contains only enough code to handle the SMB1
#     protocol negotiation (NegProt) and echo exchanges.
#
#     There are no immediate plans to implement anything beyond those two
#     since, as of this writing (Jan, 2015), the only supported version
#     of Windows that does not include SMB2 is W2k3...and that is scheduled
#     to go out of support in mid-July, 2015.
#
#     The Linux CIFS kernel client now also supports SMB2, as does Samba.
#
#     The SMB1 protocol can (and should) now retire quietly, saying only
#     "Chaos, panic and disorder...my work here is done".
#
# ToDo:
#   - The _SMB1_Echo._dump() method should itemize the Flags and Flags2
#     bitfield values, a. la. Wireshark.
#   - Several methods are missing Doctests.
#   - Several setter methods do not assert that the assigned value is
#     within the valid range for the type (e.g., 0..255 for UCHAR).
#   - The ParseSMB1 function could be tightened up a bit.  Too much
#     redundant code.

"""Carnaval Toolkit: SMB1 message parsing and composition.

"SMB1" is a new name for an old protocol.

"SMB" stands for "Server Message Block".  The original SMB protocol was
developed by IBM in the early 1980's.  It was later extended and enhanced
by 3Com, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft, resulting in several dialects that
were produced for PC-DOS, MS-DOS, and OS/2.  The most recent dialect of
the original SMB protocol is known as the NT LAN Manager dialect
("NT LM 0.12").  It was created (quite a long time ago) for Windows NT.

The new "SMB1" name generally refers to the NT LAN Manager dialect. The
Windows NT SMB stack, however, is backward-compatible with older dialects
so "SMB1" can also refer to the original SMB protocol as a whole.

With Windows Vista, Microsft introduced a completely new (but strangely
familiar) protocol known as SMB2.  Since then, Microsoft has downgraded
SMB1 to the point that it is now officially deprecated.  There are plans
to remove SMB1 from future versions of Windows.

This module currently implements only three SMB1 protocol commands:
  * SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE
    SMB1 protocol negotiation can be used as an initial step toward
    SMB2/3 protocol negotiation.  That's why we bother.
  * SMB_COM_ECHO
    This is the SMB1 equivalent of a "ping".  It is typically used as a
    keepalive, or to test an established SMB connection.  It may be
    sent following an SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE if an SMB1 dialect has been
    negotiated.  It is possible that this will never be used.
  * SMB_COM_INVALID
    This is the designated bogus command.  It generates error
    response messages.

The SMB1 protocol is specified in [MS-CIFS] and [MS-SMB].  [IMPCIFS]
provides a guide to SMB1 and related protocols, and their implementation.

#
#   _format_SMB1hdr     - The layout of an SMB1 header as a Python Struct
#                         object.  Note that the '<' character indicates
#                         little-endian encoding, which is the standard
#                         for SMB.  See the _SMB1_Header.compose() method
#                         or [MS-CIFS; 2.2.3.1] for the full layout.
#   _format_SMB1BH      - Typically used when the WordCount is zero, this
#                         structure maps to the WordCount (a byte) followed
#                         immediately by the ByteCount (two bytes).  Any
#                         data would follow the ByteCount.
#   _format_SMB1BHH     - Maps to a byte (WordCount) followed by two shorts.
#                         Used, for example, when creating a CORE protocol
#                         NegProt Response such as the "no dialect selected"
#                         message.
#   _format_SMB1H       - Extract an unsigned short, converting it from
#                         SMB byte order.
#
#   _DEF_FLAGS_REQ      - Default Flags value to use in a request.
#   _DEF_FLAGS_RSP      - Default Flags value to use in a response.
#   _DEF_FLAGS2         - Default Flags2 value for requests and responses.

    # Notes:
    #   The default command value is SMB_COM_INVALID, which was reserved
    #   in OS/2 LAN Manager documentation as an officially non-existant
    #   command.  This default must be overridden.
    #
    #   Other than the command code, all fields default to zero, including
    #   the flags fields.  Passing None for a given field will override the
    #   zero default and assign an alternative value, as described above.
    #
    #   There are a handful of header field attributes that are not exposed
    #   through this initialization method:
    #   * _protocol     - This is always "\xFFSMB", so there is no reason
    #                     to make it available as a parameter.
    #   * _secFeatures  - This is generally used for message signing,
    #                     although it can also be used for other purposes
    #                     when SMB is being carried over a connectionless
    #                     transport (see [MS-CIFS; 2.2.3.1]).  For signing,
    #                     it must be all zeros when the signature is
    #                     calculated over the completed (unsigned) message.
    #                     The signature is written to the header afterward.
    #   * _reserved     - This is a 2-byte reserved field that must be set
    #                     to zero.
    #   As is common in this collection of modules, the rules can be
    #   broken by directly setting the attribute to the desired value.

  """SMBv1 Negotiate Protocol Response message.

  When using an SMB1 NegProt to negotiate an SMB2 dialect, there are four
  possible responses from the server:

  1)  If the client sends and the server accepts the "2.???" dialect
      string, then the server should send an SMB2_Negotiate response
      indicating that the 0x02FF dialect has been selected.  0x02FF
      indicates that further processing is required, and the client
      must send a subsequent SMB2_Negotiate request.

  2)  If the client sends and the server accepts the "2.002" dialect
      string, then the server should send an SMB2_Negotiate response
      with the 0x0202 dialect selected.  0x0202 indicates that the
      "2.002" dialect has been successfully negotiated.

  In cases 1 and 2, the server should respond with an SMB2 (not SMB1)
  Negotiate Response message.

  3)  If the server supports SMB1 or earlier SMB dialect:
      If the client didn't send either SMB2 dialect string, or if the
      server doesn't support SMB2, then the server should complete SMB
      protocol negotiation.  This means that the server should either
      select one of the SMB dialects presented by the client, or return
      an index value of 0xFFFF to indicate that no suitable dialect was
      offered.

  4)  If the server does not support SMB:
      If the client did not offer any acceptable SMB2 dialect strings,
      the server should drop the connection.

  So, the server will only return an SMB NegProt response if it actually
  supports the legacy SMB protocol (SMB1 or earlier).

  As currently implemented, this class is really only suited for sending
  an 0xFFFF response to indicate that no SMB dialect was selected.  Note,
  however, that doing so will (falsely?) indicate to the client that the
  responding node does support some dialect of the original SMB protocol.

  So, in reality, SMB2 servers based upon this module should never send
  an SMB1 Negprot response.  SMB2 clients based on this module may
  receive an SMB1 NegProt response with an index value of 0xFFFF.

  A valid SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE exchange must occur before an SMB_COM_ECHO

  fact that the SMB Echo was introduced with the LAN Manager 1.0
  dialect of SMB, which means that the original CORE protocol did not
  support SMB Echo.  Until the NegProt is complete, you can't really
  know whether the request is allowed.

  The SMB_COM_ECHO can, however, be sent before a valid SMB session has
  been created.  That is, before an SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX exchange
  has occurred.  No authentication necessary.  This may (correctly) be
  seen as a security flaw in SMB1 since it allows any node out there to
  send echo requests, possibly with a large <echoCount> value.  SMB2
  does, in fact, require authentication before an SMB2 Echo can occur.

                  SMB server.  The default value is the empty string
                  (zero bytes).
